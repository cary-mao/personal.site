# About me
## Hey, My name is Cary Mao!   
I am a programming lover from China. Welcome to my space which I share my life on the web.
Here you can check out my sharings by the top navigation. In my planning, I will write in English as possible except chinese topics. So don't be surpriesed by the articles mixed in Chinese and English. 

As a Chinese, I am new to be a blogger writing in english and it really a huge challenge for me. Please tell me in time when you find out some mistakes in my expressions, either word or grammer, thanks!  

You can contact me as follow:
